            <h2>Blog Post UNO</h2>
            <p>March 22- This is the day that I was born, but like... 22 years later going on 23. I had a blast, even thouugh I stressed about school majority of the time.
                School is school though, I am currently in St. Louis visiting family and celebrating with my closest friends for my birthday and I hope everything goes as 
                planned. Until next time....

            <h2>Blog Post DOS</h2>
            <p>April 1- Been a while since I last was here but better late than never, right? Anyways, life has been hectic a bit. Balancing school, full time job, as well as
                trying to eat healthier and still make time for mental health can be very difficult as a college student. I don't have the best days, but they could definitely be worse.
                I can do nothing but be thankful to be in the position that I am in and that I have made it this far. I only hope now to finish strong. I only am worried about one class
                but I hope that it does not keep me from graduating. Well, gotta go. Talk to you soon.

            <h2>Blog Post TRES</h2>
            <p>April 17- Over two weeks since my last entry, and the semester is winding down fast! I am very anxious about this class and these finals. I am excited to graduate, but also 
                scared to no longer be a student. If you think about it, we are students from the time that we can walk and talk, until we are able to be taxed by the government without the
                collateral of your parents. I can honestly say that school did not do anything for me besisde teach me how to be a worker for the higher ups. I would have loved to learn how to 
                start a business and build generational wealth but I have to go through 15-18 years of school in order for society to deem me a credible member. It honestly is so rigged that 
                there is not a point in me even ranting this far but hey, this is my blog ya know. Anyways, I'll be back when I figure out my life and aspirations for myself after college. Much love UofM
